# public-goods-survey
Welcome to the Public Goods Survey!
Thank you for participating in this survey. The purpose of this study is to understand how individuals contribute to and punish behaviors related to public goods. Your responses will help us explore decision-making and cooperation in community-based environments.

Survey Overview:
Objective: You will be assigned a position (number) in a group of participants. You will decide how much of your $20 budget to contribute to a shared public good.
Contribution: You decide how much of your budget to contribute. The total contributions from all participants will determine the value of the public good.
Punishment: After learning the total contribution and how much your neighbors contributed, you can choose to punish one of your neighbors (the person before or after you). You can assign a portion of your $10 punishment budget to penalize the selected neighbor.
Payoff: At the end of the survey, your final payoff will be calculated based on your contribution, the public good payoff, your punishment decision (if any), and your leftover punishment budget.
Survey Flow:
You will be asked to decide how much of your $20 budget to contribute to the public good.
After all participants' contributions are recorded, you will be informed of the total public good payoff.
You will see how much your neighbors contributed and have the option to punish one of them.
If you choose to punish, you will select a neighbor and decide how much of your $10 punishment budget to use.
Your final payoff will be calculated based on the following formula:
Final Payoff = 20 - Your Contribution + Public Good Payoff + Leftover Punishment Budget - 2 Ã— Punishment Given
The survey will repeat for 5 rounds, and you will make new decisions in each round.
Important Notes:
Please make your decisions carefully. Your contributions and punishments will affect your final payoff and the outcomes of others in the survey.
All decisions are anonymous, and the data will be used solely for research purposes.
You will see your final payoff after completing the survey.
Instructions:
Follow the steps in the survey.
If you have any questions or experience any issues during the survey, please feel free to reach out to the survey administrator.
Once you've completed all rounds, your final results will be shown.
Thank you for your participation!
